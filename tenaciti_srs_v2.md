| **Pricing Model** | Free tier (roadmap extraction, limited uploads) + Pro tier (AI topic extraction from notes/slides, higher limits) |
| **Target User** | Undergraduate / Postgraduate Students |
| **Prepared By** | Development Team |

# **Table of Contents**

# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1 Purpose**

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the complete functional and non-functional requirements for Tenaciti v2.0 — a pivot from a manual academic self-tracking tool to an AI-assisted academic roadmap, note-taking, and progress-reflection application. This document supersedes Tenaciti SRS v1.0 and is the single source of truth for all development decisions going forward.

## **1.2 Vision Statement**

Students start every semester with the same stack of syllabi and end it with nothing but a transcript of grades — no record of the effort, confusion, or growth in between. Tenaciti closes that gap: it reads the documents a student already has, turns them into a living roadmap of the semester that fills itself in as the term unfolds, and lets every note, reflection, and self-assessment attach directly to the moment it belongs to. The result isn't another to-do list or another notes app — it's a single, evolving picture of how a student actually learns, so that by the end of a semester they understand not just what grade they got, but why.

## **1.3 Project Overview**

Tenaciti v2.0 ingests a student's own course documents — syllabi, Course Learning Outcome (CLO) sheets, and instructor-provided notes/slides — and uses an AI extraction pipeline to build two things automatically:

1. A **semester roadmap** per course: assessments, deadlines, weights, and topics, with explicit placeholders for anything not yet announced, which the student progressively fills in and confirms.
2. A **topic checklist** per course: the list of topics actually covered in class, extracted from uploaded lecture notes/slides, which the student checks off as they complete each one — giving a running "X of Y topics done" view per course.

An Obsidian-style personal note-taking layer sits on top of both, so that notes, roadmap nodes, and topics are all part of the same linked graph rather than three disconnected tools. The self-assessment, goal-tracking, streak, and retrospective mechanics from v1.0 are retained, now attached to auto-generated roadmap nodes and topics instead of manually created ones.

## **1.4 Problem Statement**

| **Pain Point** | **Why existing tools (including Tenaciti v1.0) fail here** |
| --- | --- |
| Cold-start setup fatigue | Manually re-creating every course, deadline, and weight from a syllabus PDF is grunt work on top of actual coursework — most students abandon the tool before it collects enough data to be useful. |
| Syllabi are incomplete on day one | Exam dates, rubrics, and topics are often announced mid-semester via email or LMS post, not in the original PDF. A one-time static import goes stale within weeks. |
| Notes live nowhere near the thing they're about | Lecture notes, deadlines, and reflections sit in three different apps with no link between them, so a student can't see whether thin notes on a topic actually predicted a weak grade. |
| No visibility into topic coverage | Students rarely have a clear, living view of "what have we actually covered so far, and what's left before the exam" — that picture exists only in scattered slide decks. |
| Students overestimate time and underestimate task complexity | Carried over from v1.0 — still unsolved by any generic task manager. |
| No personal record beyond the grade | After a semester ends, there is no record of how the student actually worked — only the final grade. |
| Goals set at the start of term are forgotten by week three | No accountability mechanism ties goals back to daily activity. |

## **1.5 Scope**

In scope for v2.2:

- **Free Tier**
  - Account creation and full course management (CRUD)
  - Document upload per course with enforced limits (see FR-00-05): syllabus and CLO files accepted
  - AI-assisted semester roadmap extraction from uploaded syllabus/CLO — powered by the platform's API key, no user key required
  - Confirm-and-edit step before any extracted data is treated as authoritative
  - Full manual roadmap/topic creation (no AI required)
  - Personal note-taking, bi-directional linking, backlinks, and graph view
  - Self-assessment logging, goal tracking, streaks, GPA calculator, profile, and retrospective

- **Pro Tier** (paid subscription)
  - Everything in Free, plus:
  - AI-assisted topic extraction from instructor notes/slides (PDF and PPT/PPTX) — the computationally heavier, per-file LLM call
  - Higher document upload limits (see FR-00-05)
  - Multi-document merge (syllabus + academic calendar) with RAG-based reconciliation
  - **GPA Calculator**: per-course grade tracking with credit hours, semester GPA, cumulative CGPA calculation, what-if scenario modelling, and integration with GPA-linked goals (available on both tiers)
  - Priority processing queue for extraction jobs

Out of scope for v2.2: LMS integration, real-time multi-user collaboration, automated grading, offline-first full-feature parity on mobile, notifications beyond streak/placeholder nudges, BYO API key support.

# **2. System Overview**

## **2.1 System Architecture**

Tenaciti v2.2 follows a three-tier architecture with an added AI extraction service, subscription gating, and two client types:

- **Web Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, communicating with the backend via REST API. Owns document upload, extraction review/confirmation, the notes graph view, retrospectives, and subscription/billing management.
- **Mobile Frontend**: Consumes the same REST API. Owns daily logging, topic check-offs, quick note capture, self-assessment prompts, and push notifications.
- **Backend**: Python/Flask exposing a RESTful API. Handles authentication, subscription tier enforcement, business logic, the extraction pipeline orchestration, and database access via SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **AI Extraction Service**: A backend module that calls the **platform-managed LLM API key** to produce structured roadmap and topic data. Free tier: roadmap extraction from syllabus only (rate-limited). Pro tier: topic extraction from notes/slides + multi-document RAG merge. The platform absorbs inference cost; Pro subscription revenue covers it.
- **Subscription & Billing**: A lightweight billing layer (e.g. Stripe or LemonSqueezy) that records the user's current plan and enforces tier gates on API routes.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL. Stores all user data, courses, documents, roadmap nodes, topics, notes, links, logs, goals, streaks, and subscription records.

## **2.2 User Roles**

| **Role** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Free User | Uploads syllabi (within limit), gets AI roadmap extraction, uses all non-AI features. Cannot access topic extraction or multi-doc merge. |
| Pro User | All Free features plus AI topic extraction from notes/slides, higher upload limits, and priority extraction queue. |
| Admin (Future Scope) | Manages accounts, monitors AI cost dashboards, views aggregate anonymised platform statistics. Not implemented in v2.0. |

## **2.3 Platform Responsibility Split**

| **Activity** | **Web** | **Mobile** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document upload (syllabus, CLO, notes/slides) | Primary | Supported |
| Reviewing/confirming AI-extracted roadmap & topics | Primary (keyboard + screen space for corrections) | View-only recommended |
| Daily logging (status updates, confidence, quick notes) | Supported | Primary |

## **2.4 High-Level User Journey**

1. Student registers (Free tier by default) and creates a semester with its courses.
2. **[Free]** Student uploads a syllabus and/or CLO file per course — upload count enforced against their tier limit.
3. **[Free]** AI extracts a draft roadmap (assessments, dates, weights) from the syllabus using the platform API key — no user key needed.
4. Student reviews, edits, and confirms the extracted roadmap before it goes live.
5. **[Pro only]** Student uploads instructor notes/slides; AI extracts a topic checklist per course.
6. **[Free — manual fallback]** Free-tier users can still create topics manually without AI extraction.
7. Through the semester (mobile-first): student fills in placeholders, checks off topics, logs confidence/effort/reflection, and captures quick notes.
8. Student writes and links fuller notes on web; backlinks and the graph view surface connections.
9. Dashboard surfaces real-time insight — overdue items, topic coverage, confidence trends, streaks.
10. At semester end, student generates a Retrospective Report.
11. Profile page reflects cumulative patterns across all semesters.
12. Free users see a contextual upgrade prompt when they hit a limit or attempt a Pro-only action.

# **3. Functional Requirements**

Each requirement is tagged with a unique ID, priority (Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have), and rationale.

## **FR-00: Subscription & Tier Management**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-00-01 | Must Have | Every new account is provisioned on the Free tier automatically | No friction to start |
| FR-00-02 | Must Have | System records each user's current plan (free / pro) and plan expiry date in the database | Gate enforcement requires a reliable source of truth |
| FR-00-03 | Must Have | Backend enforces tier gates on all Pro-only routes — a Free user calling a Pro route receives a clear `403 Upgrade Required` response | Prevents abuse and drives upgrade conversion |
| FR-00-04 | Must Have | UI displays the user's current plan and remaining upload quota on the profile/settings page | Transparency |
| FR-00-05 | Must Have | Upload limits are enforced per user per semester: **Free tier — 3 documents total per course** (syllabus-type only); **Pro tier — 20 documents per course** (all types) | Controls platform AI inference cost |
| FR-00-06 | Must Have | When a Free user reaches their upload limit, the system blocks further uploads and shows a clear upgrade prompt — it does not silently discard the file | Good UX; never lose user data |
| FR-00-07 | Should Have | Payment and plan upgrade flow is handled via an external billing provider (Stripe or LemonSqueezy); the backend only records the resulting plan status via webhook | Keeps billing logic out of core app |
| FR-00-08 | Should Have | Pro subscription can be cancelled; on cancellation, the user reverts to Free tier at the end of the billing period — previously extracted Pro data (topics, etc.) remains visible but no new Pro-only extractions are permitted | Graceful downgrade |
| FR-00-09 | Nice to Have | Admin dashboard shows: total users, free vs pro ratio, AI token cost per day, upload volume per tier | Operational cost visibility |

| FR-03-03 | Must Have | Free | Any field the source document does not specify is created as an explicit placeholder, not silently omitted | Matches the reality that syllabi are incomplete on day one |
| FR-03-04 | Must Have | Free | Extracted roadmap is shown to the student for review before being marked confirmed | Prevents silent extraction errors from being treated as fact |
| FR-03-05 | Must Have | Free | Student can edit any extracted field, add missing nodes, or delete incorrect ones during review | Trust and correctness |
| FR-03-06 | Must Have | Free | If user has reached their upload limit, the upload endpoint rejects the file with a `403` and an upgrade prompt — no file is stored | FR-00-06 enforcement |
| FR-03-07 | Should Have | Pro | System can re-process an updated/revised syllabus and merge changes into the existing roadmap without duplicating confirmed nodes | Supports mid-semester revisions |
| FR-03-08 | Should Have | Pro | System combines multiple documents (syllabus + academic calendar) into one coherent roadmap via RAG | Reduces manual reconciliation; heavier inference cost justifies Pro gate |

## **FR-10: Streak System**

| **Streak** | **Trigger** | **Breaks When** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity Streak | Student logs a meaningful action on a given day (fills a placeholder, checks off a topic, writes/edits a note, completes a self-assessment) | No qualifying action logged for a full calendar day |
| On-Time Submission Streak | Student marks a roadmap node submitted on or before its deadline | A node is submitted late or missed entirely past its deadline |

## **FR-13: GPA Calculator**

A built-in GPA tool that works both as a **standalone calculator** (independent of any other Tenaciti data) and as an **integrated feature** (reading grades from roadmap nodes, linking to GPA goals, and feeding the retrospective report). All calculation logic runs client-side (no server round-trip needed); persistence of grade entries uses the backend.

### **FR-13-A: Per-Course Grade Entry**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-13-01 | Must Have | User can record a letter grade and credit hours for each course in the current semester | Foundation of GPA computation |
| FR-13-02 | Must Have | System accepts letter grades (A+/A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/C-/D/F) and maps them to grade points automatically | Removes manual lookup friction |
| FR-13-03 | Must Have | User can type a percentage mark; system auto-converts to the nearest letter grade and grade point | Supports institutions that report scores as percentages |
| FR-13-04 | Must Have | Credit hours per course are editable; defaults can be pre-populated from course creation data | Accommodates variable-credit courses |
| FR-13-05 | Should Have | Grade point scale is user-selectable: 4.0 (default), 5.0, or 10-point | Accommodates different institutional grading systems |
| FR-13-06 | Should Have | If a roadmap node with `status = 'Graded'` and a non-null `grade` field exists, that value is suggested as the pre-fill for the grade entry | Reduces double-entry between roadmap and GPA calculator |

### **FR-13-B: Semester GPA Calculation**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-13-07 | Must Have | System computes semester GPA as Σ(Quality Points) / Σ(Credit Hours) and displays it in real time as grades are entered or changed | Live feedback drives engagement |
| FR-13-08 | Must Have | Display shows: GPA value, equivalent letter grade, total credit hours, total quality points, and a visual progress bar relative to the scale maximum | Comprehensive at-a-glance summary |
| FR-13-09 | Must Have | User can add or remove courses from the semester GPA table dynamically | Supports mid-semester course drops/adds |
| FR-13-10 | Should Have | Per-course mini breakdown (letter grade + progress bar) is shown alongside the aggregate GPA | Helps identify the weakest course at a glance |

### **FR-13-C: Cumulative GPA (CGPA)**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| FR-13-12 | Must Have | The current semester's GPA (from FR-13-07) is automatically included in the CGPA calculation as a live row | No duplication of entry |
| FR-13-13 | Must Have | CGPA display mirrors the semester GPA panel: value, letter grade, totals, and a bar | Consistent UI |
| FR-13-14 | Should Have | A GPA trend chart plots semester GPA across all recorded semesters in chronological order | Visualises academic trajectory over time |
| FR-13-15 | Should Have | User can add or remove past semester rows from the CGPA table | Corrects historical data entry errors |

### **FR-13-D: What-If Calculator**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-13-16 | Must Have | Given current GPA, current credit hours graded, remaining course credits, and a target GPA — system computes the minimum grade needed in the remaining course | Answers "what do I need to score in this exam?" |
| FR-13-17 | Must Have | If the required grade exceeds the maximum (e.g. >4.0 on a 4.0 scale) system clearly states the target is not achievable with those inputs | Prevents false hope |
| FR-13-18 | Must Have | Given a hypothetical grade for a remaining course — system computes the predicted end-of-semester GPA | Answers "what happens to my GPA if I get a B?" |
| FR-13-19 | Should Have | A scenario comparison table shows all common letter grades for a given remaining course and the resulting GPA and goal status for each | Eliminates repetitive manual recalculation |

### **FR-13-E: Standalone Calculator Mode**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-13-20 | Must Have | A dedicated "Standalone" tab allows entry of arbitrary course names, credits, and grades without linking to any Tenaciti course or semester | Users who just want a quick GPA check without setting up a full semester |
| FR-13-21 | Must Have | Standalone calculator output (GPA, letter grade, quality points) is computed entirely client-side with no data persisted | Privacy; no unintended record creation |
| FR-13-22 | Should Have | Standalone mode shows a grade-scale reference table (A → 4.0, B+ → 3.3, etc.) for the selected scale | Reduces lookups |

### **FR-13-F: Goal Integration**

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-13-23 | Should Have | A goal can be flagged as a "GPA Goal" with a target GPA value (e.g. "Achieve ≥ 3.3 this semester") | Connects the goal system to the GPA calculator |
| FR-13-24 | Should Have | The GPA Calculator page displays all active GPA-linked goals with a live status indicator (Met / X away / Not achievable) that updates as grades are changed | Motivational feedback loop |
| FR-13-25 | Should Have | The Goal Status panel inside the GPA Calculator checks at minimum: target GPA met, Dean's List threshold (configurable), and academic probation risk (< 2.0) | Common milestone awareness |
| FR-13-26 | Nice to Have | Dashboard surfaces a GPA goal progress summary card when at least one GPA goal is active | Brings GPA tracking into the daily view |

# **7. AI Extraction Pipeline**

## **7.1 Approach**

- **Single document (e.g. one syllabus):** one structured-output LLM call (function calling / JSON schema) is sufficient — no retrieval step needed.
- **Multiple documents per course or semester (e.g. syllabus + academic calendar + a mid-semester addendum):** a lightweight retrieval step selects relevant passages from each document before the extraction call, so the roadmap can be updated incrementally without re-processing everything.
- **Instructor notes/slides for topic extraction:** each uploaded file is processed independently and appended to the course's topic list, since new materials typically arrive week by week rather than all at once.

## **7.2 Confirm-before-lock (mandatory)**

No extracted field — roadmap node or topic — is treated as authoritative until the student has reviewed it. Every extracted item is shown in one of three states: **Confirmed**, **Needs Review** (default state on first extraction), or **Placeholder** (field intentionally left blank because the source document didn't specify it). This step exists because syllabus formats are inconsistent (tables, prose, scanned/OCR'd PDFs) and extraction will sometimes misread a date or weight — the app must never let a wrong auto-extracted deadline masquerade as a real one.

## **7.3 Cost, Privacy & Tier Model**

### Platform API Key Architecture
- **Tenaciti manages a single LLM API key** (recommended: Gemini API for cost-efficiency). All extraction calls are made server-side using this key — users never see, provide, or manage any AI credentials.
- **Free tier inference cost** is subsidised by the platform. Roadmap extraction from a typical syllabus costs ~$0.001–$0.003 per call (Gemini Flash pricing). With upload limits of 3 docs/course, worst-case cost per free user per semester is very small (~$0.01–0.03).
- **Pro tier inference cost** covers heavier topic extraction from slides/notes (more tokens, more calls). Pro subscription revenue is designed to cover this: even at $3–5/mo per Pro user with ~10 extraction calls/semester, the margin is comfortable.

### Tier Enforcement
| Action | Free | Pro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syllabus/CLO upload | ✅ Up to 3/course | ✅ Up to 20/course |
| Notes/slides upload | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Up to 20/course |
| Roadmap extraction (AI) | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| Topic extraction (AI) | ❌ `403 Upgrade Required` | ✅ Included |
| Multi-doc RAG merge | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Included |
| Manual topic creation | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited |
| All non-AI features | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |

### Privacy
- Uploaded documents may contain instructor names and institution-specific policy text. This is disclosed clearly before the first upload.
- Documents are stored per-user and never shared across accounts or used to train models.
- Extraction failures fall back to an empty, manually-editable roadmap/topic list — onboarding is never blocked by an AI error.

### AI Cost Control Mechanisms
- **Rate limiting**: Free tier capped at 3 extraction calls per course per semester (enforced by upload limit).
- **File size limit**: Maximum 10 MB per uploaded file for Free; 25 MB for Pro — prevents runaway token usage.
- **Async queue**: All extraction jobs run asynchronously. A per-user concurrency limit (1 active job for Free, 3 for Pro) prevents abuse.
- **Token budget**: Extraction prompts are structured to request only the needed JSON schema, keeping token counts predictable.

# **10. Risks, Assumptions & Constraints**

## **10.1 Assumptions**

- A single developer is building this project initially.
- Application runs on free/low-cost hosting tiers at launch (~50 users).
- Free-tier inference cost (roadmap extraction) is low enough (~$0.01–0.03/user/semester) to absorb with zero initial revenue.
- A meaningful fraction of active users (target: 10–15%) will convert to Pro within 6 months.
- Data volume per user will not exceed roughly 1,000 roadmap nodes/notes combined.

## **10.2 Risks**

| **Risk** | **Likelihood** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extraction accuracy varies widely across syllabus formats | High | Mandatory confirm-before-lock step; never auto-apply unreviewed data; manual-entry fallback always available |
| Free-tier AI cost exceeds revenue at early scale | Medium | Upload limits cap worst-case spend; monitor cost dashboard (FR-00-09); can tighten limits without code changes |
| Low Pro conversion rate makes AI cost unsustainable | Medium | Keep Free tier genuinely useful (full manual mode + roadmap AI); position Pro on the high-value pain point (topic extraction = most time-saving feature) |
| LLM API pricing changes (platform key model) | Low-Medium | Abstract the LLM provider behind an adapter; can switch providers or tighten token budgets without changing product behaviour |
| Uploaded instructor materials raise copyright/privacy questions | Medium | Store per-user only, never shared or used to train models, disclosed clearly in privacy notice |
| Mobile/web sync conflicts (edits on both while offline) | Medium | Last-write-wins with a visible conflict flag on notes; keep mobile edits scoped to append-mostly actions |
| Scope creep across two clients and an AI pipeline | High | Strictly sequence phases; mobile v1 ships with a deliberately reduced feature set (see 2.3) |
| Note graph becomes noisy/unmanageable at scale | Low-Medium | Filter graph view by course by default; full-text search as a fallback discovery method |

## **10.3 Constraints**

- Backend/web tech stack: HTML/CSS/JS, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, REST API.
- AI extraction uses a **platform-managed API key**; BYO key support is explicitly out of scope.
- Upload limits (3 docs/course Free, 20 docs/course Pro) are a hard constraint driven by AI cost control — not a soft suggestion.
- Billing provider (Stripe or LemonSqueezy) must support webhook-based plan updates; the app never processes payment card data directly.
- Budget at launch: near-zero infra cost; Pro revenue covers AI inference as the user base grows.
